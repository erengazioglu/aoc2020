# notes for day 1

the puzzle gives an input which is a bunch of numbers and asks to find two numbers whose sum is 2020, and multiply them together

i'll be using python for everything, so first i'll understand how to use atom for python

for that i need to:  
* convert the data into an array (parsing)
* sort the list (probably descending)
* use an algorithm to compare numbers
* the function returns the two numbers that total 2020
* then multiply them and print the result

### atom for python

installed a bunch of packages etc, now pressing f5 runs the file


### parsing
